College students completed baseline and seven-\\nday daily assessments. The results indicated that a greater exposure to daily stressors and high levels of trait\\naggression predicted more daily somatic symptoms. Trait aggression moderated the in ﬂuence of daily resilience\\non somatic symptoms, in which higher levels of resilience was associated with fewer somatic symptoms only for\\nthose with high levels of aggression but not for those with medium or low levels of aggression. The ﬁndings\\nsuggest the importance of considering daily stressor and trait aggression in screening for clinic visits for somatic\\nsymptoms. The ﬁndings also underscore the importance of aggression being a marker in prevention programs\\nand enhancing resilience, particularly for aggressive individuals in preventing somatic symptoms.\\n1. Introduction\\nSomatic symptoms or somatization are medically unexplained\\nsymptoms including unpleasant bodily sensations (e.g., nausea) or\\nphysical dysfunctions (e.g., pains in heart/chest) in certain body parts\\nor organs ( Garralda, 2010 ). Somatic symptoms have been reported to\\nbe highly prevalent among clinical populations, such as individuals\\nwith post-traumatic stress disorder ( Gupta, 2013), or those with chronic\\nlife stress ( Gouin, Glaser, Malarkey, Beversdorf, & Kiecolt-Glaser,\\n2012). However, the association between stress and somatic symptoms\\nhas been less studied in the context of daily life.\\nDaily stressors and relevant emotional reactions (i.e., stress) are\\nassociated with a temporary increase in physical arousal and psycho-\\nlogical distress ( Almeida, Neupert, Banks, & Serido, 2005 ). Aggregated\\neﬀects of daily stress over several days may have a lasting impact on\\nhealth (Leger, Charles, Turiano, & Almeida, 2016 ). Research with cross-\\nsectional and longitudinal designs have consistently shown that stress is\\nrelated to mental and physical health ( O'Connor, Walker, Hendrickx,\\nTalbot, & Schaefer, 2013 ; Schat, Kelloway, & Desmarais, 2005 ) and\\nthese associations also depend on individual di ﬀerences (e.g.,\\nZunhammer, Eberle, Eichhammer, & Busch, 2013 ). Recently, an in-\\ncreasing amount of research has adopted diary methods to delineate the\\nassociation of daily stressors to health and well-being. For example, a\\nstudy involving clinical and college samples revealed that a ﬀective\\nreactivity to daily stressors prospectively predicted depressive symp-\\ntoms (Cohen, Gunthert, Butler, O'Neill, & Tolpin, 2005). Another study\\nfound that increased a ﬀective reactivity to daily stressors predicted\\ngreater general a ﬀective distress and increased likelihood of reporting\\nan a ﬀective disorder in 10 years later ( Charles, Piazza, Mogle,\\nSliwinski, & Almeida, 2013) and heightened long-term risk of reporting\\na chronic physical health condition ( Piazza, Charles, Sliwinski, Mogle,\\n& Almeida, 2013 ). By assessing individuals' experiences in a daily set-\\nting, these ﬁndings enhanced ecological validity, reduced memory\\ndistortion, and allowed for testing within-person variations. The current\\nstudy capitalized on the aforementioned bene ﬁts of a diary method and\\nexamined the in ﬂuence of within- (i.e., exposure to daily stressor, daily\\nresilience) and between-person (i.e., aggression) variables on somatic\\nsymptoms.\\n1.1. Resilience\\nResilience captures the ability to assess a stressful situation, re-ap-\\npraise negative emotions with positive ones, bounce back from stress,\\nand promote adaptation in the midst of challenges ( McRae, Ciesielski, &\\nGross, 2012). Research has identi ﬁed the protective role of resilience on\\nmental and physical health ( De Robert, Barontini, Forcada, Carrizo, &\\nAlmada, 2010; Schure, Odden, & Goins, 2013). Individuals with higher\\nresilience tend to exhibit greater stress resistance and more quickly turn\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110141\\nReceived 4 December 2019; Received in revised form 16 April 2020; Accepted 25 May 2020\\n⁎ Corresponding author at: 3034 Sandage Ave, Fort Worth, TX 76109, United States of America.\\nE-mail address: yang.yang@tcu.edu.\\nPersonality and Individual Differences 165 (2020) 110141\\n0191-8869/ © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.
