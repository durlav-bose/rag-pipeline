His work, though technically \\nprofound, was not the pinnacle of his aspirations. Secretly, within the confines of his mind, an idea brewed\\n—a startup venture that fused the realms of business literature and personal enterprise.\\nYet, Jack was a man unacquainted with the art of the subscription-based SaaS model. His vision was \\nuncharted territory. A realm where classic books like ‘Lean Startup’ became personal roadmaps for \\nsolopreneurs. But he was not without his struggles, and as he sat contemplating, his mind recoiled at the \\ncomplexities that lay ahead.\\nThe day began with dissonance. Jack found himself entrenched in a boardroom scene that played out like \\nan intricate dance of power and numbers. It was a gathering of minds, each weighted by the financial \\npressures that threatened to unsettle their corporate balance. “We are losing momentum,” declared \\nMartin, the CFO, his voice a harbinger of unease. “The market is shifting, and our competitors are closing \\nin.”\\nThe presentation slides bore witness to this reality—exact numbers highlighted in glaring red, projections \\nof dwindling market shares, and a competitive landscape fraught with threats. Jack absorbed this with a \\nstoic façade, even as his mind churned with the enormity of the challenge.\\nAway from the chaos of the office, his home offered little respite. The interactions with Maria, his wife, \\nmirrored the tensions of his professional life. Their conversations, once marked with warmth, now carried \\nthe weight of unspoken worries. “You’ve been distant lately,” Maria observed, her tone a blend of concern'),\n",

His colleagues, each a vivid \\ncharacter in his daily narrative, represented a microcosm of the larger environment. It was a place where \\ntechnical brilliance met administrative hierarchies, and Jack navigated it with a finesse that belied his \\ninternal struggles.\\nHis mind, however, was a cauldron of relentless introspection. Thoughts cascaded in intricate \\nassemblages of fears, hopes, and expectations. The specter of his unfulfilled ambition loomed, a \\nconstant shadow in his waking dreams. What if his venture were to falter before it took flight? The fear \\nwas palpable, the excitement undeniable—a confluence of emotions that defined his every waking \\nmoment.\\nJack was not entirely alone in his pursuit. His allies, a cadre of vibrant personalities, each brought a \\nunique hue to his otherwise grayscale existence. There was Clara, the marketing maven whose strategic \\nprowess was matched only by her eloquence. Tom, the developer, was a symphony of creativity and code. \\nTogether, they formed a team that mirrored Jack’s own complexity—an amalgamation of passions and \\npursuits.\\nAmidst the dialogues of industry jargon and heartfelt conversations, a glimmer of inspiration emerged—a \\npotential path that promised to transform his vision into reality. Inspired by the principles of validated \\nlearning, Jack began to see a way forward—an approach that would allow him to test his assumptions, \\nminimize risks, and perhaps, pave a sustainable path for his embryonic enterprise.\\nThe introduction of this principle was subtle at first, an undercurrent in his day-to-day experiences. \\nUnbeknownst to Jack, it was this very philosophy that would serve as the keystone in his quest for \\ninnovation. In the hushed tones of late-night brainstorming, in the fervor of morning meetings, the concept \\nbegan to take shape—a philosophy that startups exist to learn how to build a sustainable business.\\nThe first notes of this symphony of transformation were playing, and Jack, though unaware, was about to \\nembark on a journey that would redefine his understanding of both business and self.\\nThe Art of Discovery\\nThe week that followed was a whirlwind of discovery and introspection for Jack. As winter cloaked \\nHeidelberg in its cold embrace, Jack found solace in the warmth of his thoughts. The idea that had \\nlingered at the edges of his consciousness now demanded center stage.\\nHe had heard whispers of a methodology that could potentially guide him through the tumultuous seas of'),\n",

He found himself leafing through pages filled with insights that challenged his \\npreconceived notions.

Jack found himself wrestling with the implications \\nof this newfound knowledge. His mind oscillated between excitement and doubt, the duality of hope and \\nfear.\\nIt was during these moments of introspection that Jack turned to his journal. Here, he poured out his \\nthoughts, documenting his journey—a chronicle of transformation that intertwined his professional \\nendeavors with personal revelations.\\nThe pages became a testament to his evolving mindset, capturing the essence of his internal dialogue. \\n“To move forward,” he mused, “one must first acknowledge the possibility of failure and persevere.”\\nDetermined to translate theory into practice, Jack initiated small experiments within his current business \\nventure. He tested new approaches, measuring their impact and adjusting his methodology based on the \\nfeedback received.'),\n",

As a full-stack developer, he reveled in the logic of \\ncode, the thrill of creating seamless applications. Yet, with every project that came his way, he felt a \\ngrowing sense of unease. He was on the cusp of a transition to DevOps, yet something was holding him \\nback.\\nHis latest project involved collaborating with an international team. Durlav had been excited at first, but as \\nthe days turned into weeks, he found himself increasingly frustrated. Communication, it seemed, was a \\ntangled web of misunderstandings. He had often brushed aside the importance of soft skills, believing \\nthat technical expertise alone would suffice. But with every missed deadline and unclear expectation, he \\nrealized he was losing something crucial: the ability to connect.\\nDuring a particularly challenging video call with an American client, Durlav felt a wave of anxiety wash \\nover him. The client’s frustration was palpable, their words a blur of urgency and disappointment. Durlav’s \\nheart raced; he couldn’t quite grasp what had gone wrong. As he sat there mute, his mind was flooded \\nwith self-doubt. Did his accent make him harder to understand? Did he misinterpret cultural cues?\\nIn that moment of vulnerability, a thought flickered to life: perhaps the key to overcoming this turmoil lay \\nnot in improving his technical skills, but in embracing empathy. What if he sought to understand his \\nclient’s perspective, their frustrations and victories? What if he listened not just to respond, but to truly \\nhear?\\nAs the call ended, Durlav took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his confusion begin to lift. He opened a \\nnew document and typed out a simple message to his client: “I want to understand your needs better. Can'),\n",

Perhaps there was \\na way to illuminate the path ahead.\\nHe recalled a conversation with an old mentor, Maya, a seasoned strategist who had guided him through \\nthe complexities of customer engagement. “Think of it as mapping a treasure hunt,” she had said, her \\neyes sparkling with enthusiasm. “Each step your customer takes is a clue, leading them closer to their \\ngoals. Your task is to uncover those clues and reveal any hidden traps along the way.”\\nDurlav grabbed a blank sheet of paper and began sketching the customer journey like a roadmap. He \\noutlined each phase: awareness, consideration, decision, and loyalty. With every stroke, he visualized the \\nsteps his clients took, from the first moment they discovered a product to the moment they became loyal \\nadvocates. But with each phase came a surge of skepticism. Would this exercise truly reveal the pain \\npoints he suspected were lurking beneath the surface?\\nAs he mapped out their processes, Durlav began to identify inconsistencies and bottlenecks. Customers \\nmight find it easy to browse but faced hurdles at checkout, a common pitfall that frustrated many. It \\ndawned on him that this wasn’t just about identifying problems; it was about crafting solutions tailored to \\nindividual needs. He felt a newfound clarity wash over him, as if he were peeling back layers of complexity \\nto unveil a vibrant tapestry of opportunities.\\nThe metaphor of the treasure hunt resonated deeply. Each customer was a unique traveler on their quest, \\nand the map Durlav was drawing could serve as both a guide and a shield against potential setbacks. \\nWith renewed determination, he realized that understanding the customer’s journey was not merely a \\ntactical exercise; it was a powerful act of empathy.\\nDurlav leaned back in his chair, a sense of purpose settling around him like a comforting cloak.

He struggled to \\nremember her words while formulating his next question, instead of fully engaging with her. The \\nconversation quickly stumbled into awkward silences as he fumbled for his notebook, tapping the pen \\nagainst the page.\\n“Um, how do you decide on a theme for your work?” he finally blurted, but the question felt shallow, \\nlacking the depth he intended.

Durlav could feel the trust slipping away, \\nand with it, the insights he had hoped to gain.

On the other, “Frequency”—how often the problem occurred. Each seed (or insight) would \\nfind its place in this garden based on where it fell on the grid. The seeds that sprouted in the top right \\ncorner, with high pain and high frequency, would be his most urgent priorities.\\nAs he filled in the grid, Durlav felt a rush of excitement.

The \\nnaïveté of his initial enthusiasm had long been replaced by the harsh reality of market dynamics and \\nconsumer expectations. He was, at his core, a Frontend Architect with a deep-seated passion for \\ntechnology, but the business landscape felt like uncharted territory.\\nBefore he could sink deeper into despair, his phone buzzed to life. It was a message from his mentor, \\nFelix, a seasoned entrepreneur who had successfully navigated the same waters Jack now found himself \\nin. “Jack, remember, the fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how \\ncustomers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. Let’s discuss strategies tomorrow; I \\nthink a fresh perspective might help.”\\nThe words were like a lifeline thrown into his ocean of uncertainty. Despite the impending issues, there \\nwas an inkling of hope ignited within him. Perhaps there was a way out of his predicament—perhaps the \\nLean Startup methodology could offer him a map to navigate through these stormy seas.\\nAs Jack prepared for the upcoming day with Felix, a thought flickered in his mind—a glimmer of a new \\nidea that could reshape everything. What if, instead of focusing solely on their current product, they could \\nleverage the classic principles of Lean Startup defined by Eric Ries? Perhaps if he could absorb those \\nteachings and adapt them to his personal aspirations and the innovative spirit of his startup, he could turn \\nthis ship around. It was time to discover new systems, foster innovation, and truly understand the needs \\nof his customers.\\nWith a newfound determination, he began drafting a list of potential book adaptations. In particular, a \\nthought struck him: he could help solopreneurs, like himself, to transform their ideas into structured \\nbusinesses through the strategies outlined in classic entrepreneurial literature. It was this epiphany—the \\nbridge between his love for writing and his passion for technology—that could spark a radical shift in his \\njourney. Maybe, just maybe, there was a way to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that aligned both \\nhis dreams and the needs of those who walked a path similar to his own. But first, he needed a plan.\\nDiscovery of the Lean Mindset - Seeds of Change\\nThe following day, sitting across from Felix in a small, bustling coffee shop, Jack felt a rush of nervous \\nenergy as he sipped his espresso. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, igniting his senses \\nwhile the chatter of patrons acted as a backdrop to their important discussion. Felix had always had an \\nuncanny ability to draw clarity from chaos, and today was no exception.\\n“Jack, let’s start with the basics—what do you think is the most critical aspect of ensuring a startup’s'),\n",

Jack paused, considering the question that held the \\nweight of his burgeoning future. “I think… I think it’s understanding what the customer truly needs,” he \\nreplied tentatively, feeling his internal doubts surfacing again.\\nFelix nodded knowingly. “Exactly. That’s where validated learning comes into play. You can’t just create a \\nproduct in a vacuum; you need to gather insights directly from potential customers. This process of \\ntesting your hypotheses will help you mitigate risks associated with building unwanted features.”\\nAs they spoke, Jack’s mind raced with ideas. Felix shared stories about his past struggles and triumphs, \\nemphasizing the importance of becoming an adaptive entrepreneur. They delved into the concept of \\nbuilding a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)—that bare-bones version of what you want to launch that will \\nprovide valuable feedback from customers with minimal investment. Each word Felix spoke resonated \\ndeeply, challenging Jack to rethink his approach to launching his ideas.\\n“You need to focus on building, measuring, and then learning, Jack. It’s an iterative cycle that can propel \\nyou toward sustainable growth. You’ll have failures, but each failure will teach you something important. \\nRemember, the ultimate goal of a startup isn’t just to make stuff or make money—it’s to learn how to build \\na sustainable business,” Felix explained with fervor.\\nWith each passing moment, Jack felt a fire igniting within him. Ideas began to swirl around him—a vision \\nfor the MVP , a structured process for collecting validation and feedback. They discussed potential \\ncustomer segments Jack could target—solopreneurs like himself, those with aspirations to bring their \\nideas to life but lacking the structured guidance necessary to do so.\\n“I’d like to create a platform that assists other solopreneurs in adapting classic business texts to their \\nunique contexts. Imagine if they could leverage Lean Startup principles to develop their businesses \\nstrategically!” Jack exclaimed, his enthusiasm palpable. Felix’s eyes sparkled with excitement. “That’s the \\nspirit! But remember, you need to do this in small, manageable steps. Start with an MVP—test your idea \\nbefore going all in. You don’t want to build a full-fledged product without knowing if there’s a demand for \\nit.”\\nAfter their meeting, Jack set off to do extensive research. He immersed himself in Eric Ries’s book, taking \\nnotes, and distilling concepts that resonated with his vision. He attended online webinars, scoured \\nforums, and connected with fellow entrepreneurs. Through this exploration, he felt a mixture of \\nskepticism and curiosity. Would this really be the pathway to success? Would others find his approach \\nvaluable?\\nEach piece of information acted as a building block, and soon, he began sketching out the first draft of his \\nplatform. The potential for becoming a resource for solopreneurs swirled in his mind—a comprehensive \\nguide that would help them turn their aspirations into actionable plans based on validated learning.\\nAs the days progressed, the emotional journey was tumultuous. Jack experienced waves of hope and \\nskepticism alike. The excitement of a fresh idea came with the weight of potential failure looming over'),\n",

I want to create something that not \\nonly resonates with others but also embodies the entrepreneurial spirit I believe in,” Jack articulated with \\nconviction. Felix agreed to help, and they scheduled regular sessions to iterate on Jack’s concept. \\\\n\\nIt was during one of these sessions that Jack faced his greatest challenge yet—his own fears of \\ninadequacy. “What if I can’t pull this off? I’ve never built a subscription-based SaaS before!” Jack \\nconfessed, his voice trembling slightly. Felix leaned forward, his gaze steady. “Every successful \\nentrepreneur faces uncertainty. The key is to embrace it and learn from it. You’re already on the right path \\nby seeking guidance and being open to feedback. Keep iterating, testing, and adjusting. You’ve got this, \\nJack.”\\nWith renewed determination, Jack began prototyping his idea. He crafted a tagline for his platform: \\n“Transform Classic Wisdom into Actionable Business Strategy.” The excitement built within him as he \\nmade connections in the entrepreneurial community, seeking input and feedback on his proposal. He felt \\nenergized, and as he poured his heart and soul into developing this concept, it began to evolve into \\nsomething tangible. This journey toward creating an MVP felt less like a burden and more like a mission, \\none that could intertwine his love for literature and technology into a meaningful enterprise.\\nFor the first time in months, Jack felt a sense of clarity and purpose.

The journey to bring his idea to life had truly begun.\\nThe First Steps - Implementing the Lean Principles\\nThe excitement that burned within Jack as he began to implement his Lean Startup principles was \\npalpable. He spent hours each day in front of his laptop, tapping into a wealth of information gathered \\nfrom his research, webinars, and conversations with Felix. The foundation of his MVP was taking shape: a \\ndigital platform designed to serve solopreneurs by helping them adapt insights from classic business \\nliterature into actionable strategies for their unique situations.\\nJack mapped out the development phases of his MVP , focusing first on creating a simple website to \\nshowcase his vision and offer valuable resources. He devoted one weekend to building the initial site, \\npouring his heart into crafting content and structuring the layout to be user-friendly.\\nA few days later, with the website launched, it was time to start measuring the response from his target \\naudience. Jack crafted a small survey, asking potential users about their needs and challenges in turning \\ntheir ideas into actionable business strategies. He shared the survey on various entrepreneur forums,'),\n",

But inside, a voice urged him forward, whispering: “To make a difference, to innovate, to help \\nothers navigate like I wish I could have.”\\nHis thoughts kept circling back to the principles of the Lean Startup. “Build-Measure-Learn” had become \\nhis mantra. He recalled one of Eric Ries’s pivotal quotes: “The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn \\nideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.” How \\ncould he, given his nascent stage, apply this wisdom?\\nA New Beginning and Setting a Vision  Jack’s current struggle was the very first step. “How do I translate'),\n",

The room felt \\nstifling; its walls seemed to close in on him. He could see the remnants of his last brainstorming session \\nscattered on the desk: notes, diagrams, a list of potential features for his MVP (Minimum Viable Product). \\nEach component felt like a strand of a spider’s web — interconnected yet delicate, ready to collapse at any \\nmoment.\\nAs he scrolled through various articles on entrepreneurship, he stumbled upon a phrase that resonated \\ndeeply: “The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.” It was a quote from Eric Ries that echoed \\nin his mind, instilling a flicker of hope.

College students completed baseline and seven-\\nday daily assessments. The results indicated that a greater exposure to daily stressors and high levels of trait\\naggression predicted more daily somatic symptoms. Trait aggression moderated the in ﬂuence of daily resilience\\non somatic symptoms, in which higher levels of resilience was associated with fewer somatic symptoms only for\\nthose with high levels of aggression but not for those with medium or low levels of aggression. The ﬁndings\\nsuggest the importance of considering daily stressor and trait aggression in screening for clinic visits for somatic\\nsymptoms. The ﬁndings also underscore the importance of aggression being a marker in prevention programs\\nand enhancing resilience, particularly for aggressive individuals in preventing somatic symptoms.\\n1. Introduction\\nSomatic symptoms or somatization are medically unexplained\\nsymptoms including unpleasant bodily sensations (e.g., nausea) or\\nphysical dysfunctions (e.g., pains in heart/chest) in certain body parts\\nor organs ( Garralda, 2010 ). Somatic symptoms have been reported to\\nbe highly prevalent among clinical populations, such as individuals\\nwith post-traumatic stress disorder ( Gupta, 2013), or those with chronic\\nlife stress ( Gouin, Glaser, Malarkey, Beversdorf, & Kiecolt-Glaser,\\n2012). However, the association between stress and somatic symptoms\\nhas been less studied in the context of daily life.\\nDaily stressors and relevant emotional reactions (i.e., stress) are\\nassociated with a temporary increase in physical arousal and psycho-\\nlogical distress ( Almeida, Neupert, Banks, & Serido, 2005 ). Aggregated\\neﬀects of daily stress over several days may have a lasting impact on\\nhealth (Leger, Charles, Turiano, & Almeida, 2016 ). Research with cross-\\nsectional and longitudinal designs have consistently shown that stress is\\nrelated to mental and physical health ( O'Connor, Walker, Hendrickx,\\nTalbot, & Schaefer, 2013 ; Schat, Kelloway, & Desmarais, 2005 ) and\\nthese associations also depend on individual di ﬀerences (e.g.,\\nZunhammer, Eberle, Eichhammer, & Busch, 2013 ). Recently, an in-\\ncreasing amount of research has adopted diary methods to delineate the\\nassociation of daily stressors to health and well-being. For example, a\\nstudy involving clinical and college samples revealed that a ﬀective\\nreactivity to daily stressors prospectively predicted depressive symp-\\ntoms (Cohen, Gunthert, Butler, O'Neill, & Tolpin, 2005). Another study\\nfound that increased a ﬀective reactivity to daily stressors predicted\\ngreater general a ﬀective distress and increased likelihood of reporting\\nan a ﬀective disorder in 10 years later ( Charles, Piazza, Mogle,\\nSliwinski, & Almeida, 2013) and heightened long-term risk of reporting\\na chronic physical health condition ( Piazza, Charles, Sliwinski, Mogle,\\n& Almeida, 2013 ). By assessing individuals' experiences in a daily set-\\nting, these ﬁndings enhanced ecological validity, reduced memory\\ndistortion, and allowed for testing within-person variations. The current\\nstudy capitalized on the aforementioned bene ﬁts of a diary method and\\nexamined the in ﬂuence of within- (i.e., exposure to daily stressor, daily\\nresilience) and between-person (i.e., aggression) variables on somatic\\nsymptoms.\\n1.1. Resilience\\nResilience captures the ability to assess a stressful situation, re-ap-\\npraise negative emotions with positive ones, bounce back from stress,\\nand promote adaptation in the midst of challenges ( McRae, Ciesielski, &\\nGross, 2012). Research has identi ﬁed the protective role of resilience on\\nmental and physical health ( De Robert, Barontini, Forcada, Carrizo, &\\nAlmada, 2010; Schure, Odden, & Goins, 2013).

Resilience also bu ﬀers the association of childhood ad-\\nversity to distress and somatic symptoms ( Beutel et al., 2017). A study\\nusing mature college students (25 years or older) found that cognitive\\nhardiness, a concept pertaining to the personality trait type of resi-\\nlience, predicted less somatic symptoms among male participants after\\ncontrolling for stressful life events ( Beasley, Thompson, & Davidson,\\n2003).\\nThe majority of research speaking to the link between resilience and\\nhealth focuses on a general state of resilience. However, resilience is\\nalso referred to as the capacity of a dynamic system and regulatory\\nﬂexibility that allow people adapt successfully to disturbances threa-\\ntening people's ecological systems ( Southwick, Bonanno, Masten,\\nPanter-Brick, & Yehuda, 2014 ). This deﬁ nition has a great relevance to\\neveryday life wherein successful adaptation depends on contextual\\ncharacteristics. In this area, to the author's best knowledge, only one\\nresearch has examined the role of resilience in a daily context in rela-\\ntion to general well-being. In this study using 113 employees, it was\\nfound that daily resilience bu ﬀered the spillover e ﬀect of daily work\\nstress from work to nonwork domains and resulted in less daily strain-\\nbased work-nonwork con ﬂict ( Martinez-Corts, Demerouti, Bakker, &\\nBoz, 2015). Another study looked at perception of control (a resilience\\nfactor) in daily settings within a broad age range of individuals (range\\n18–89) and revealed that daily perception of control bu ﬀered the as-\\nsociation of stress to negative a ﬀect ( Diehl & Hay, 2010). Given the\\nepisodic nature of daily stressors, more research is needed to examine\\nthe role of resilience on somatic symptoms in a daily context.\\nIn addition to time-varying factors, dispositional characteristics may\\nalso a ﬀect health ( Hampson & Friedman, 2008) in ways that these\\ncharacteristics in ﬂuence the appraisal and coping of the stressors,\\nwhich in turn exacerbate or alleviate distress ( Leger et al., 2016 ; Smith,\\n2006). The existing research has primarily focused on personality traits\\nsuch as neuroticism and extraversion ( Leger et al., 2016 ; Mroczek &\\nAlmeida, 2004), more studies are needed to examine the role of other\\ndispositional characteristics, such as aggression, in the association be-\\ntween exposure to daily stressors, resilience, and somatization.\\n1.2. Aggression\\nTrait aggression refers to an individual's predisposition to engage in\\nverbal and physical aggression, hostile cognitions, and expression of\\nanger (Buss & Perry, 1992 ). Relatedly, aggression can be perceived as a\\nmechanism to cope with stress or serve as a defense mechanism to in-\\nstigation factors (such as a threat or provocation resulted from stres-\\nsors) and often involves negative emotions such as anger, hostility, and\\nfrustration (C. A. Anderson, Deuser, & DeNeve, 1995 ; Kruk, Halász,\\nMeelis, & Haller, 2004 ; Shorey et al., 2012 ; Ursin & Olﬀ, 1995; Wyckoﬀ,\\n2016).\\nThese resultant emotional reactions often induce physiological\\narousals, such as enhanced sympathetic nervous system activation\\n(Christie & Friedman, 2004 ) and increased heart rate, breathing rate,\\nand blood pressure ( Mendes, Major, McCoy, & Blascovich, 2008). These\\nphysiological reactions can have a deleterious e ﬀect on health\\n(American Psychological Association, 2019 ). Although enhanced phy-\\nsiological responses may be transient after a stressful episode, ag-\\ngressive individuals may be more prone to experiencing physical\\narousals and the aggregation of these negative e ﬀects may have an\\nenduring e ﬀect on health.\\nPeople with dispositional aggression are more susceptible to nega-\\ntive social stimuli ( Smith & Waterman, 2004; Wilkowski, Robinson,\\nGordon, & Troop-Gordon, 2007 ). The General Aggression Model\\n(Anderson & Bushman, 2002 ) posits that people with a predisposition to\\nthe perception of aggression may be more likely to respond with ag-\\ngression even to neutral or ambiguous events. With high levels of stress,\\naggressive people are more prone to negative emotional states (e.g.,\\nanger) and adopt emotion-focused coping (e.g., emotional responses to\\nstress) strategies. In addition, emotion-focused coping may lead to\\npsychological dysfunction and somatic symptoms (e.g., Beasley et al.,\\n2003; Higgins & Endler, 1995). Stress moderation models ( Smith, 2006)\\nposit that personality moderates the appraisal and coping in response to\\nstressful events, which in turn in ﬂuence physiological responses con-\\ntributing to illness. In the same vein, the cognitive-a ﬀective stress re-\\nsponse model ( Woﬀord & Daly, 1997 ) states that an individual's stress\\npropensity (an individual cognitive trait factor; such as aggression)\\nmoderates the relationships of stressors to cognitive-a ﬀective processes\\nand experienced a ﬀective reactions. In response to stressor stimuli,\\nindividuals who possess traits indicating a strong cognitive-a ﬀective\\nstress propensity experienced more negative cognitive-a ﬀective pro-\\ncesses than those who do not ( Woﬀord & Goodwin, 2002). Another\\nstudy found that cognitive-a ﬀect stress propensity exacerbated the re-\\nlation between experienced a ﬀective reactions and strain ( Woﬀord,\\nGoodwin, & Daly, 1999 ). Thus, people with aggressive tendency may\\nexperience pronounced negative a ﬀective reactions, which would in\\nturn heighten the risk of somatic symptoms.\\nGiven aggressive people prone to a stressful stimulus, the protective\\nrole of resilience is important, particularly for those with high aggres-\\nsion tendency. Previous studies have shown that resilience is negatively\\nassociated with anger expression in adolescents ( Anderson, 2006 ), ag-\\ngression and hostility among college students ( Mojrian, Homayouni,\\nRahmedani, & Alizadeh, 2017),\\n anger in military personnel ( Maddi,\\nBrow, Khoshaba, & Vaitkus, 2006 ), and aggression in adults being\\nabused in childhood ( Cirillo, 2000). A study found that a mindfulness-\\nbased resilience intervention reduced stress reactivity and aggression\\nand enhanced sleep quality in law enforcement o ﬃ cers ( Christopher\\net al., 2018 ). Therefore, it is crucial to examine the protective role of\\nresilience in somatic symptoms in aggressive individuals who are more\\nsusceptible to stressful stimulus and thus developing somatization.\\n1.3. Current study\\nThe literature has revealed (1) the association of stressors and re-\\nsilience to somatic symptoms, and (2) the association between aggres-\\nsion and health. However, the majority of the literature focuses on life\\nevents or chronic stressors. Also, most of the studies are based on the\\ncross-sectional or longitudinal studies (e.g., Beutel et al., 2017 )i n\\nwhich either resilience served as a general state or proxy factors of\\nresilience in daily settings (e.g., daily control; Diehl & Hay, 2010 ) were\\nused. Also, despite a great implication of personality traits on the ap-\\npraisal of stressors and relevance to health, less research has been\\nconducted to delineate how dispositional aggression plays a role in the\\nassociation between risk and protective factors and somatic symptoms\\nin a daily setting. Building upon the literature, the current study\\nadopted a diary method to assess daily functioning over seven con-\\nsecutive days and examined (1) the association of daily stressors and\\nresilience to somatic symptoms, and (2) the moderation of trait ag-\\ngression on these associations. It was hypothesized that more daily\\nstressors and lower resilience were associated with more somatic\\nsymptoms. It was also hypothesized that trait aggression exacerbated\\nthe negative impact of daily stressors on somatic symptoms in which\\nthe association between daily stressors and somatic symptoms was\\nstronger among individuals with high aggression than their counter-\\nparts. Given aggressive individuals being prone to stressors and devel-\\noping somatization, it was hypothesized that trait aggression attenuated\\nthe protective impact of resilience on somatic symptoms, wherein more\\nresilience was associated with fewer somatic symptoms only for in-\\ndividuals with less aggression but not for those with high aggression.\\nNeuroticism is a personality trait often marked by increased sus-\\nceptibility and emotional reaction to daily stressors ( Suls & Martin,\\n2005). Daily diary studies have revealed its association with stress-re-\\nlated health concerns ( Leger et al., 2016; Smith, 2006). Negative a ﬀect\\nmay impact the interpretation of health-related symptoms, which in\\nturn a ﬀect symptom reporting ( Cohen & Rodriguez, 1995 ; Mayne,\\n1999).

Methods\\n2.1. Participants\\nA total of 248 ( Mage = 19.65, SD = 3.53) college students were\\nrecruited from intro-level psychology classes in a public university at a\\nsouthern state. Seventy-two percent of the participants were female.\\nSelf-reported race of the sample was 67% Caucasian, 24% African\\nAmerican, 9% others. The majority of the participants were freshmen\\n(56%) or sophomore (21%). The data were collected during the spring\\nand fall semesters of 2019. As for the family socioeconomic status, 26%\\nof the participants reported annual family income < 30,000, 15% be-\\ntween 30,000 and 49,999, 22% between 50,000 and 74,999, and\\n37% > 75,000. All participants provided informed consent and were\\ngranted course credits for participation. The study was approved by the\\nuniversity institutional review board.\\n2.2. Procedure\\nParticipants completed a baseline assessment, which included de-\\nmographic and dispositional characteristics at a study lab. After the\\nbaseline assessment, participants also responded to the ﬁrst daily as-\\nsessment (see Table 1 in the supplementary ﬁle). During days two to\\nseven, participants received an email with the survey link at 6 p.m. and\\nwere asked to complete the survey by midnight. Participants were in-\\nstructed to complete the survey each day between 6 p.m. and 12 a.m. to\\ncontrol for any potential time of day e ﬀects. The baseline assessment\\nand the ﬁrst daily assessment took approximately 30 min on site. Daily\\nassessments took 5 min per day for six successive days after baseline via\\nonline survey administration. Participants received course credits for\\nparticipation. Participants were recruited throughout the weekdays to\\nreduce the potential in ﬂuence of the day of the week.\\n2.3. Measures\\n2.3.1. Between-person independent variables\\n2.3.1.1. Trait aggression . Aggression was measured using the Buss-\\nPerry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ; Buss & Perry, 1992), which\\ncontains 29-items comprised of four subscales: physical aggression\\n(nine items), verbal aggression ( ﬁve items), anger (seven items) and\\nhostility (eight items). The questionnaire uses a 5-point scale (1 = not\\nat all like me;5= very much like me). The BPAQ has shown good\\ninternal consistency for the total BPAQ score ( α = 0.89, Buss & Perry,\\n1992; α = 0.87 in the current sample). The mean score of the entire\\nscale was used in data analysis.\\n2.3.1.2. Neuroticism . Neuroticism was assessed by the Neuroticism\\nscale form the Midlife Developmental Inventory Personality Scales\\n(Lachman & Weaver, 1997 ). Participants responded to the stem\\nquestion “Please indicate how well each of the following describes\\nyou” for the four items “moody,”“ worrying,”“ nervous,” and “calm”\\n(reversed) using a 0 ( not at all) – 3( a lot) response scale ( α = 0.72 in the\\ncurrent sample). The mean of the scale was used in data analysis.\\n2.3.2. Within-person variables\\n2.3.2.1. Daily stressor . Daily stressors were assessed through a semi-\\nstructured\\nDaily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) ( Almeida,\\nWethington, & Kessler, 2002 ). The DISE assesses the occurrence of\\ndaily stressors in various life domains (arguments or disagreements,\\navoided arguments and tensions, home events, work events, events\\noccurring to the respondent's close other, and discrimination). Each day\\nparticipants indicated whether they experienced each of these stressor\\ntypes by answering yes (1) or no (0) to a series of forced-choice\\nquestions (e.g., Did you have an argument or disagreement with anyone\\ntoday?) in the past 24 h for the ﬁrst daily assessment and since the\\nprevious assessment for the rest of daily assessments. The total number\\nof stressors was computed and used in data analysis.\\n2.3.2.2. Daily resilience . Daily resilience was assessed by a short version\\nof the resilience scale to capture individuals' capacity to bounce back\\nfrom di ﬃ culties and disturbances in daily life ( Martinez-Corts et al.,\\n2015). Three items of the scale were rated on a 5-point Likert scale\\nranging from 1 ( strongly disagree)t o5( strongly agree). A sample item is:\\n“Today, I got through di ﬃ cult times because I've experienced di ﬃ culty\\nbefore.” The three-item scale demonstrates good reliability in daily\\nsurveys ( Martinez-Corts et al., 2015 ; α for the seven consecutive days\\nranging from 0.66 to 0.82 in the current sample). The mean score was\\nused in data analysis.\\n2.3.2.3. Daily somatic symptoms . Each day participants completed the\\n7-item Somatization subscale of the Brief Symptom Checklist\\n(Derogatis, 1993). Participants were asked to report how often\\nsymptoms (i.e., “faintness”, “pains in heart/chest” , “nausea”, “trouble\\ngetting breath ”, “hot/cold spells ”, “numbness”, “weakness of body ”)\\nhave been experienced since the previous day on a ﬁve-point Likert\\nscale ranging from 0 ( not at all )t o4( extremely). The scale has good\\nreliability ( α ranging from 0.79 to 0.87 for seven daily assessments in\\nthe current study). The mean score was used in data analysis.\\n2.3.2.4. Daily negative aﬀ ect. Each day, participants were asked to rate\\nhow much felt each a ﬀective state (e.g., distressed, sad) on a scale\\nranging from 1 ( not\\n at all)t o5( extremely) by the Positive and Negative\\nAﬀect Schedule scale ( Mackinnon et al., 1999 ), which demonstrates\\ngood reliability in the current sample (Cronbach's α ranging from 0.77\\nto 0.85 over seven consecutive days). The mean score was used in data\\nanalysis.\\nTwo time-varying variables were included. Weekend status was de-\\nﬁned as 6 pm on Friday through 6 pm on Sunday and dichotomized into\\nthe weekend (1) and weekday (0). Days was deﬁ ned as which day\\nduring the 7-day period (Day 1 = 0) ( Miranda et al., 2019 ). In addition\\nto neuroticism and negative a ﬀect, age, gender (men = −1,\\nwomen = 1), race (minority = −1, Caucasian = 1), weekend status,\\nand days of daily assessments were included in the data analysis as\\ncovariates.\\n2.4. Statistical analyses\\nMultilevel modeling ( Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002 ) was used to test\\nthe relations of within-person and between-person variables and daily\\nsomatic symptoms. Within-person variables were centered on group\\nmean, and between-person variables were centered on the grand mean\\n(Singer & Willett, 2003 ). The data analyses were performed in two\\nsteps.

Second, multilevel modeling was tested on\\nthe in ﬂuence of daily variables, between-person variables, and cross-\\nlevel interactions on daily somatization. Third, an additional set of\\nmultilevel models with lagged predictors for somatization was con-\\nducted in order to examine whether exposure to daily stressors and\\nresilience at the previous day (i.e., lagged) was associated with the next\\nday's somatization. In the lagged model, concurrent predictors (i.e.,\\npredictors at the present day) were interpreted as change in that pre-\\ndictor relative to the previous day. However, preliminary analyses re-\\nvealed that the main e ﬀect of lagged predictors or the interactions\\nbetween lagged predictors and aggression were not signi ﬁcant (see\\nTable 2 in the supplementary ﬁle). Thus, the results of step 3 were\\ndropped in the further data analysis. In addition, random slopes were\\nincluded in the model to account for random variation across partici-\\npants in the associations between daily variables and the dependent\\nvariable, but the random slopes were not signi ﬁcant except the slope of\\ndays in all analyses and the slope of negative a ﬀect in the models with\\nlagged predictors. Therefore, random slopes were not included, with\\nthe aforementioned exceptions.\\nParticipants completed 1355 assessments over the course of the\\nseven-day period. Overall assessment compliance was de ﬁned by the\\ntotal assessments completed by all participants divided by total random\\nassessments plus missed random assessments, and thus the overall\\ncompliance was 78%, ranging from 76% to 85% across six days (except\\nthe ﬁrst day). The missingness of daily assessments was not correlated\\nto gender ( ps > 0.25), age ( ps > 0.18), race ( ps > 0.06), aggression\\n(ps > 0.33), or neuroticism ( ps > 0.20).\\n3. Results\\nUnconditional models revealed that 57% of the variance in daily\\nsomatization was between-person ( τ\\n00 = 0.12), and 43% of the var-\\niance was within-person ( σ2 = 0.09). Thus, there was su ﬃ cient\\nvariability to justify multilevel analyses. Correlations between the mean\\nof within-person variables across seven days, aggression, and neuroti-\\ncism were explored to reveal preliminary results of the correlations\\nbetween key variables and the covariates (see Table 1). The results\\nindicated that the average level of somatic symptoms across seven days\\nwas correlated with all key ( p < .01 for daily resilience; p < .001 for\\nother) but stress ( p = .54) predictors.\\nMultilevel modeling on moderation e ﬀects (see Table 2) revealed\\nthat exposure to daily stressors ( b = 0.04, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.06],\\np < 0.001) and trait aggression ( b = 0.07, 95% CI: [0.00, 0.014],\\np = 0.05) signi ﬁcantly predicted daily somatic symptoms. In addition,\\nthe interaction between daily stressor exposure and aggression\\n(b = 0.03, 95% CI: [0.00, 0.06], p = 0.02) and the interaction between\\nresilience and aggression were signi ﬁcantly associated with daily so-\\nmatic symptoms ( b = −0.07, 95% CI:[ −0.13, 0.00], p = 0.04). Both\\nwithin- and between-person covariates (i.e., negative a ﬀect and neu-\\nroticism) were signi ﬁcant as well.\\nSimple e ﬀects were examined to unpack the in ﬂuence of daily re-\\nsilience on somatic symptoms for low (-1 SD), medium ( mean) and high\\n(+1SD) aggressive individuals ( Preacher, Curran, & Bauer, 2006 ). The\\nresults (see Fig. 1) indicated that daily resilience was not associated\\nwith somatic symptoms for those with low ( b = 0.02, S.E. = 0.02,\\np = .30) or medium ( b = −0.02, S.E. = 0.02, p = .19) levels of trait\\naggression. However, for those with high trait aggression, more resi-\\nlience was associated with fewer somatic symptoms, b = −0.06,\\nS.E. =\\n0.02, p = .002.\\n4. Discussion\\nUsing a daily diary design, the current study examined the impact of\\nexposure to daily stressors, daily resilience, and trait aggression on\\ndaily somatic symptoms, and the moderation of aggression on the in-\\nﬂuence of daily stressor exposure and resilience on somatic symptoms.\\nExposure to daily stressors and trait aggression were associated with\\ndaily somatic symptoms. Trait aggression moderated the inﬂ uence of\\nresilience on somatic symptoms.

It is also\\nimportant to note that while daily stressors being a risk factor to so-\\nmatization, other psychological functioning (such as, resilience) and\\npersonality traits (e.g., aggression) also play an important role in de-\\ntermining the risk of somatic symptoms.\\nThe previous studies have revealed the deleterious role of trait ag-\\ngression on health ( Lahad, Heckbert, Koepsell, Psaty, & Patrick, 1997 ;\\nTilov, Semerdzhieva, Bakova, Tornyova, & Stoyanov, 2016 ) as well as\\nsomatization in speci ﬁc( Smith, 2006). The current ﬁndings on the\\npositive association between trait aggression and daily somatic symp-\\ntoms indicated that trait aggression also had a signi ﬁcant impact on\\nsomatic symptoms in daily life. Trait aggression moderated the inﬂ u-\\nence of resilience on somatic symptoms, in which high resilience was\\nassociated with fewer somatic symptoms only for those with high levels\\nof aggression, but not for those with medium or low levels of aggres-\\nsion. Resilience could be deemed as a process in which adaptive systems\\nand processes are being nurtured in the midst of challenges ( Masten,\\n2001). Individuals with high trait aggression are more susceptible to\\ndaily stressors and, thus, have more opportunities to make an e ﬀort to\\nadapt. Thus, aggressive individuals with high levels of resilience may be\\nmore skilled at adopting active coping strategies in response to daily\\nstressors, which serves as a protective factor to experiencing somatic\\nsymptoms. This ﬁnding is aligned with the literature indicating that\\nresilience helps people who are in adversity adapt more adequately\\n(e.g., Ng, Ang, & Ho, 2012 ; Sirois & Hirsch, 2013 ). For those without\\nhigh aggressive tendencies, they may not have su ﬃ cient exposure to\\nadversity and, thus, are not inoculated from stressors. It is also possible\\nthat, for individuals with less aggressive tendencies, resilience is not a\\nsigniﬁcant protector to preventing from somatic symptoms; rather other\\nfactors, such as family cohesion ( Liu, Liu, & Zhao, 2017 ), may serve as a\\nprotective factor to somatic symptoms. Therefore, the protective role of\\nresilience is more pronounced among aggressive individuals than non-\\naggressive individuals.\\nThe ﬁndings have implications for how health practitioners could\\ntreat individuals with somatic complaints and promote health in gen-\\neral. Clinicians may consider including daily stressors and aggression in\\nscreening for risk factors to health. It is also vital to include coping skills\\nfor daily stressors in prevention and treatment programs to reduce\\nproblems associated with body functioning. The current study also\\nhighlights the importance of aggression being an intervention marker.\\nInterventions (e.g., anger management therapy, cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy) designed to address the susceptibility of negative stressors may\\nhelp reduce the risk of developing somatic symptoms. In addition to\\nprograms reducing aggression, interventions that enhance resilience\\nmay be also bene ﬁcial for people with high aggression.\\n4.1. Limitation and future directions\\nThere were several limitations to the current ﬁndings. Notably, the\\nsample for this study was not representative of diverse populations.\\nParticipants were college students, primarily women in emerging\\nadulthood in a southern state. The results may not be generalized to\\nother populations, including members of other age groups or socio-\\neconomic backgrounds, or those in di ﬀerent geographic areas.\\nAdditionally, while the daily dairies provide valuable insight into the\\nthoughts and feelings of the individuals in a daily context, the self-re-\\nported measures of the variables bear some limitations, such as report\\nbias and social desirability. Although seven-day assessments are su ﬃ -\\ncient for examining within-person variability, daily assessments across\\na longer period of time may allow for an opportunity to capture a\\ngreater within-person variability and, thus, provide more information\\non\\nthe role of each predictor on somatization. Even though resilience\\nand aggression are pertaining to the appraisal of stressors, the current\\nstudy did not address the impact of stressor appraisal on somatic\\nsymptoms per se. The current study examined the composite impact of\\na variety of daily stressors; however, each daily stressor may have a\\nunique yet di ﬀerent in ﬂuence on somatic symptoms among di ﬀerent\\nindividuals. For example, the in ﬂuence of discrimination stressors may\\nbe more pronounced among members of gender or racial minority\\ncompared to their counterparts. Such research has implications for re-\\nducing health disparities. Relatedly, although gender and race were\\nincluded as covariates, the current study did not examine gender and\\nracial di ﬀerences in the hypothesized associations. Given the im-\\nportance of addressing health disparities, future research may consider\\nexamining the moderation of gender and race in the association be-\\ntween stress, resilience, aggression, and somatic symptoms in a daily\\nsetting.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nYang Yang: Conceptualization, Methodology, Formal analysis,\\nWriting - original draft.\\nAppendix A.
